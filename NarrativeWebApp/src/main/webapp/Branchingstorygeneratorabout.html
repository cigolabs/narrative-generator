		<h2> You can start by opening a story word (button on the top of the page)</h2>
			<br><br>
		    The aim of this application is to generate automatically plots that contain multiple branches. 
			<br>
			Given an initial setup (defined in the "<b>Story world</b>" tab), the service will 
			generate multiple plots in a single run, ("<b>Story generation</b>" tab).<br>
		    This is obtained by using Automated planning techniques (based on heuristic search, FF) adapted for generating branching plots while maximising the randomness of the generated plots . 
			<br>
			After the generation process, it is possible to filter the stories ("<b>Story analysis</b>" tab) 
			using different techniques and can be finally merged (based on the
			world state at each step) so to obtain a single branching story.
	</p>
	<p class="c0">
		<span>This set up allows to generate a number of variations on
			the same initial setup, and even to merge different generations
			coming from different set-ups having the same initial state and
			propositions, but for example different objectives. </span>
	</p>
	
	<p class="c0">
		<span>The application works in three phases: </span>
	</p>
	<ol class="c9" start="1">
		<li class="c3 c0"><span><b>Story world creation:</b> <br>the
				author must write the domain and problem specifications using the
				standard
		</span><span class="c7">PDDL</span><span>&nbsp;language. It is advised
				to look at the existing examples as the can be a useful reference
				for creating new domains. For PDDL reference see: <br>
		</span><span class="c4"><a
				href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning_Domain_Definition_Language">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning_Domain_Definition_Language</a></span><span><br></span><span
			class="c4"><a 
				href="http://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~patrik/pddlman/writing.html">http://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~patrik/pddlman/writing.html</a></span><span><br>
				Our system supports the basic STRIPS functionalities and negated
				preconditions; currently it will not support ADL and other advanced
				features.<br>Finally, a simple text template is used to convert
				actions as defined in PDDL into a more readable form. </span></li>
		<li class="c3 c0"><span><b>Story world generation:</b><br>Stories
				are generated based on a specific problem and a set of parameters
				for the generation process. There is a set of branching algorithms
				we have created to generate branching stories that are variated and
				generated efficiently; this can be chosen as &lsquo;Branching
				algorithm&rsquo;. Help on the specific parameters is given as
				tooltips on the Story generation stage.
		</span></li>
		<li class="c0 c3"><span><b>Story analysis</b></span></li>
	</ol>
	<ol class="c8" start="1">
		<li class="c5 c0"><span>Similarity filtering:<br>This
				section allows to apply different filters to the generated stories.
				Since many generated stories are only trivially different, it is
				possible to filter out similar stories and keep only the most
				different stories. The user can select the similarity measure to
				filter stories that are too similar.
		</span><span><br>It is also possible to u</span><span>se the text
				template to filter based on the text representation of the actions
				(that usually contains less details of the action). For example, the
				actions: <br>(kill hunter wolf forest gun) &nbsp;and (kill
				hunter wolf home gun) are converted using the text template to: the
				hunter killed the wolf using his powerful gun. This means that using
				the text template, the location is considered not relevant and the
				two actions are considered to be the same.
		</span></li>
		<li class="c5 c0"><span>Property based filtering:<br>To
				support the expression of the personality of the characters by
				defining filtering based on:<br>- Action properties: a set of
				characteristics for the actions: for each action, we can define the
				level of each characteristic, in a 0_1 scale, for example: <br>Action
				kill: violence 0.8 airness 0.1 adventurous 0.
		</span><span>3<br></span><span>- Character properties: a set of
				characteristics for each character, that define the personality
				traits of the character. This can be expressed in the same
				characteristics used for the actions<br>- Story properties: set
				of characteristics for the whole story.<br>The story is then
				filtered base on how good is the match between action and character
				or story properties. Only the best stories are filtered and the user
				can chose the percentage of stories to keep.
		</span></li>
		<li class="c0 c5"><span>It is finally possible to see the
				filtered stories as text, or in a tree or graph representation. It
				is also possible to play the merged story graph as in interactive
				fiction. <br>
